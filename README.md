# Client-ServerCommunication
This is the application for client-server communication (TCP) where the data between the client and the server is sent encrypted and signed in digital form. Data for encryption and signature must be read from the X509 digital certificate, which must be pre-installed on the computer (s) on which client and server applications start.
